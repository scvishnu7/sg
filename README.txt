Suggestion Box
==============

The idea of the box is

	Orgination could host a page on their subdomin. eg. sg.lts2gether.com
	The index page will show the admin selected Topics to comment on, along with a textarea to write comment.
	The user can suggest on topic by #hashtag and tag people by @name
	The admin can view the suggestion received till.
	Admin will be able to sort and group the suggestion on topics, tagged people, suggested time.
	No suggestion can be deleted from page.


As the main philosophy of the app is ananymous suggestion, No information(Ip, user agent, port and so on) about the user will be stored.
