Suggestion Box
==============

Electronic Suggestion box for organization to replace the physical suggestion boxes.

The idea of the box is

	* Orgination could host a page on their subdomin. eg. sg.abc.org
	* Admin could post #issues on which user could suggest on
	* The user can suggest on topic by #hashtag (admin suggested or not) and tag people by @name
	* The admin can view the suggestion received.
	* Admin will be able to sort and group the suggestion on topics, tagged people, suggested time.


As the main philosophy of the app is ananymous suggestion, No information(Ip, user agent, port and so on) about the user will be stored.
