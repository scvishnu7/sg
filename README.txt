Suggestion Box
==============

The idea of the box is<br/>
<nl>
	<li>Orgination could host a page on their subdomin. eg. sg.lts2gether.com</li>
	<li>The index page will show the admin selected Topics to comment on, along with a textarea to write comment.</li>
	<li>The user can suggest on topic by #hashtag and tag people by @name</li>
	<li>The admin can view the suggestion received till. </li>
	<li>Admin will be able to sort and group the suggestion on topics, tagged people, suggested time.</li>
	<li>No suggestion can be deleted from page</li>
</nl>

As the main philosophy of the app is ananymous suggestion, No information(Ip, user agent, port and so on) about the user will be stored.
